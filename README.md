# next5

Basic demonstration of a next 5 web application.
I didn't end up implementing an API as I was notified that it wasn't required after all- and my request didn't get approved.
It has also been deployed it here: http://mitech2.wpengine.com/next5/php/index.php
Should be fine, although I did run into some small caching issues with wordpress.
