# next5

Basic demonstration of a next 5 web application.
I didn't end up implementing an API as I was notified that it wasn't required after all- and my request didn't get approved.
Should be fine, although I did run into some small caching issues with wordpress.

I would have ideally preferred to use the API, but instead created CSV files to contain information based on the assumptions.
